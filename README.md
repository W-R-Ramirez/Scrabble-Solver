# Scrabble-Solver
GUI application which takes a Scrabble puzzle from the user and outputs the solution

Ok, so there's some lingo in the code that you need to know:

    a space is the smallest thing on the board, there are 81 per board.
   
    a square is one of the squares made of 9 spaces
   
    a row is a row of 9 spaces
   
    a column is a column of 9 spaces
   
    a bro is a space that's in a row, column, or square of a certain space, but is not the space(e.g. A1 is bros with A5(column) B2(square) G1(row)
    
    rows and columns are areas. (I want squares to be areas too, but the code gets too weird because of my class structure).
